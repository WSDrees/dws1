		<p>Shepherd’s Pie is originally an English dish, traditionally made with lamb or 
		mutton. Americans typically make Shepherd’s Pie with beef, I think mostly because 
		we are much more of a beef-eating culture than a lamb-eating one. 
		The English (and Australians and New Zealanders) call the beef dish a “cottage pie”. 
		Naming conventions aside, our American version of Shepherd’s Pie is essentially a 
		casserole, lined with cooked meat and vegetables, topped with mashed potatoes, 
		and baked.</p>
		
		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 1/2 lbs ground beef</li>
			<li>1 onion chopped</li>

			<li>1 1/2 - 2 lbs potatoes (3 big ones)</li>
			<li>8 tablespoons butter (1 stick)</li>
			<li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>

			<li>Salt, pepper, other seasoning of choice</li>

			in large frying pan.</li>

			the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat has initially cooked.</li>
			<li>Add ground beef and sauté until no longer pink. Add salt and pepper. Add worcesterchire sauce. 
			Add half a cup of beef broth and cook, uncovered, over low heat for 10 minutes, 
			adding more beef broth as necessary to keep moist.</li>
			<li>Mash potatoes in bowl with remainder of butter, season to taste.</li>
			<li>Place beef and onions in baking dish. Distribute mashed potatoes on top. 
			Rough up with a fork so that there are peaks that will brown nicely.
