			<ul>
				<li>The background picture is soothing and reminds me of a nice weekend at the beach.</li>
				<li>The white and orange text on a blue background, makes it very easy to read.</li>
				<li>The sections of text are aligned and consolidated for a quick and simple read.</li>
				
			</ul>
		
		<h2 id="witheringbeauty">Withering Beauty</h2>
		
		<p>I chose the Withering Beauty layout because of the details which reminds me of a family holiday. If you would like to view it

			<ul>
				<li>While some of the headings in orange are hard to read. The color of the headings fits perfectly with the layout, in my opinion.</li>
				<li>The background photo gives a warm feeling of a family holiday, get together.</li>
				<li>The icon's that separate the paragraphs, give it a smooth flow when reading.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h2 id="museum">Museum</h2>
		
		<p>I chose the Museum layout because of the simplicity and flow of the design. If you would like to view it 
		<a target="_blank"

			<ul>
				<li>The way that the paragraphs are sectioned to look like they are mounted in a museum makes it really easy to see the separation and creates a smooth flowing design.</li>
				<li>The three colors black, white and grey help portray a smooth flowing design.</li>
				<li>I like the way that the first letter of every paragraph is a different font and font size. I makes it easier to note which section is which. </li>
			</ul>
