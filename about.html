		<h2>San Fermin in Nueva Orleans</h2>

		Mickey Hanning was born on the Westbank of New Orleans. During an inebriated 
		Mardi Gras in 2001 he promised a comrade he would test his bravado in Pamplona. 
		One-and-a-half years later, he made good on that promise to attend Sanfermines 
		(the festival in Pamplona). During Mardi Gras 2007, he & La Madrina birthed the

		<h2>Wisconsin State Cow Chip Throw</h2>		
		<p>Prairie du Sac, WI, USA</p>
		<p>The first pioneers that settled in the Plains faced Indians and unfriendly land. 
		The desire to own a home and land to raise a family gave the settlers the 
		determination to brave the difficult conditions. The scarcity of water and 
		timber for fuel and shelter, plus extreme weather conditions, made life hard and 
		lonely. Bitter winters found the settlers desperate for fuel.</p>

		<p>Buffalo hunters had found that buffalo chips could be used for fuel. Most of 
		the buffalo were gone by the time the settlers came, so they had to rely on the 
		"cow chip" for furnishing fuel to cook their food and warm their homes.</p>

		<p>When dry, the chips were odorless, gave a clean, bright flame and burned 
		with intense heat, without soot. Chips were gathered and stored for the winter 
		as autumn approached. The cow chip was a life-sustaining utility and was often 
		used in trade for food or anything the pioneers needed.</p>
		
		<h2>Wooly Worm Festival</h2>		
		<p>Banner Elk, NC, USA</p>
		<p>Back in the late 1970s, the editor of the now-defunct Mountain Living 
		Magazine, Jim Morton, was preparing to include a Woolly Worm Forecast in the 
		winter issue of the magazine. He photographed the first Woolly Worm he saw to 
		use in formulating the prediction and illustrating his story, but the next day 
		he saw a second worm that looked completely different from the!</p>

 		<p>”That’s when it struck me that we needed some formal procedure to use to 
 		decide which was going to be the official worm for making the winter 
 		forecast,” said Morton.</p>
		
		<h2>World Championship Punkin Chunkin</h2>		
		<p>Bridgeville, DE, USA</p>
